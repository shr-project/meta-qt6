# It really depends on order of the layers appearing in BBLAYERS
# variable in toplevel bblayers.conf file, where bitbake will search
# for .inc files and others where bitbake uses BBPATH since it will
# search the directories from first to last as specified in BBPATH
# Therefore if you want a given layer to be considered high priority
# for the .inc and .conf etc. then consider it adding at the beginning
# of BBPATH. For bblayers bitbake will use BBFILES_PRIORITY to resolve
# the recipe contention so the order of directories in BBFILES does
# not matter.

# We have a conf and classes directory, append to BBPATH
